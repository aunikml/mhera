1. Introduction
1.1. Project Purpose

The Mental Health Emergency Response & Assessment (MHERA) platform is an AI-augmented web application designed to support mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in emergency contexts, such as refugee crises or climate-related disasters. The system aims to streamline the initial assessment of victims, provide para-counselors with actionable insights, and facilitate timely, prioritized interventions.

1.2. Scope and Objectives

Objective 1: To develop a secure, role-based system for collecting baseline mental health data from disaster victims.

Objective 2: To leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) via the Hugging Face API to generate a preliminary psychological assessment, severity rating, and suggested actions based on collected data.

Objective 3: To provide para-counselors with a unified interface to review victim data, AI assessments, and plan interventions.

Objective 4: To visualize aggregated, anonymized data on a GIS map for regional and sub-regional situational awareness.

Objective 5: To build a flexible backend that allows for managing and selecting different AI model APIs in the future.

1.3. Target Audience

System Administrators: Manage users, regions, and system configurations.

Frontliners / Data Collectors: Field personnel responsible for interacting with victims and inputting initial data using a standardized assessment tool.

Para-counselors: Trained personnel who review assessments, validate AI suggestions, and manage the intervention and follow-up process for victims.

1.4. Definitions and Acronyms

MHERA: Mental Health Emergency Response & Assessment

AI: Artificial Intelligence

LLM: Large Language Model

GIS: Geographic Information System

API: Application Programming Interface

Victim: An individual receiving support through the platform.

Baseline Data: Initial information collected from a victim via the assessment tool.

2. System Overview
2.1. System Description

MHERA is a Django-based platform. Data Collectors use a mobile-friendly web interface to register victims and fill out a structured assessment form, which includes quantitative scores (based on pre-set rules) and qualitative observations. This data is submitted to the backend, which then queries a Hugging Face LLM. The AI analyzes the data and generates a structured output: a preliminary assessment summary, a severity score, and potential next actions. This entire record is then presented to a region-assigned Para-counselor for review, validation, and action.

2.2. User Roles and Responsibilities

Frontliner/Data Collector:

Registers new victims.

Conducts baseline assessments and enters data.

Enters specific, qualitative observations.

Can only view victims they have registered.

Para-counselor:

Views all victims within their assigned region/sub-region.

Reviews victim data, tool outcomes, and AI-generated assessments.

Accepts, rejects, or modifies AI suggestions.

Records intervention plans and follow-up notes.

Communicates with victims (via a future chat module).

System Administrator (Implied Role):

Manages user accounts and roles.

Defines regions and sub-regions.

Manages the API key and endpoint for the AI service.

2.3. High-Level System Workflow

Enrollment: Admin enrolls Frontliners and Para-counselors, assigning them to a specific region.

Data Collection: Frontliner logs in, registers a new victim, and fills out the assessment form.

AI Assessment: Upon submission, the system sends a structured prompt to the Hugging Face API.

AI Response: The AI returns a JSON object containing the assessment, severity, and suggestions.

Para-counselor Review: The Para-counselor is notified or sees the new case on their dashboard. They review the complete record, including a clear disclaimer about the AI's probabilistic nature.

Intervention: The Para-counselor documents their own evaluation and the chosen intervention plan.

Follow-up: The Para-counselor schedules and records multiple follow-up sessions.

Aggregation: Data is anonymized and aggregated for regional dashboards and the GIS view.

4. Functional Requirements
FR-100: User Management & Authentication

FR-101: The system shall provide a secure login page for users.

FR-102: The system shall support three roles: Admin, Frontliner, Para-counselor.

FR-103: Admins shall be able to create, update, and deactivate user accounts.

FR-104: When creating a Frontliner or Para-counselor, the Admin must assign them to a specific Region and Sub-Region. This data is mandatory for GIS indexing.

FR-200: Data Collection & Victim Management

FR-201: Frontliners shall be able to create a new profile for a victim, including basic demographic data.

FR-202: A standardized assessment tool (web form) will be available to collect baseline data.

FR-203: The tool's outcome (e.g., a score) will be calculated automatically based on pre-set rules defined in the backend.

FR-204: The assessment form will include a dedicated text field for "Specific Observations" where the Frontliner can enter qualitative notes.

FR-205: Para-counselors shall be able to add multiple "Follow-up" entries for each victim, each with a date and notes.

FR-300: AI-Powered Assessment Module

FR-301: On submission of a new baseline assessment, the system shall automatically trigger the AI module.

FR-302: The AI module will analyze the calculated tool outcome and the qualitative "Specific Observations".

FR-303: The AI shall generate an output with three components:

Initial Assessment: A short, personalized summary (2-3 sentences).

Severity: A classification into one of three pre-defined categories (e.g., Low, Moderate, High Priority).

Suggested Next Actions: A bulleted list of 2-3 potential interventions (e.g., "Recommend immediate safety check," "Schedule non-urgent follow-up," "Consider referral to specialized care").

FR-304: The AI-generated output must always be displayed adjacent to a clear and prominent Accuracy Disclaimer: "This is an AI-generated assessment. It is a preliminary suggestion and MUST be verified by a trained human para-counselor before any action is taken."

FR-400: Para-Counselor Workflow

FR-401: Para-counselors will have a dashboard listing all victims in their assigned region.

FR-402: The victim list will be presented in a table format with columns for: Victim ID, Date, Tool Score, AI Severity, and Status.

FR-403: Clicking on a victim will open a detailed view. This view will show the tabulated data from the assessment, the full AI-generated assessment (with disclaimer), and a section for the Para-counselor's own evaluation.

FR-404: The Para-counselor must be able to add their own notes and formally document the chosen intervention plan.

FR-500: Dashboards and Reporting

FR-501: Victim Dashboard: A dedicated page for each victim compiling their history: baseline data, all AI assessments, all follow-up notes, and a (future) chat log.

FR-502: Regional Dashboard: An overall dashboard view for Admins and Para-counselors showing aggregated statistics for their region/sub-region (e.g., Number of victims, Severity distribution pie chart, Average follow-up time).

FR-600: GIS Integration

FR-601: The system shall display a GIS map on a main dashboard.

FR-602: The map will display defined regions and sub-regions as polygons.

FR-603: Each region/sub-region on the map will display a summary of key metrics (e.g., total victims, number of high-priority cases).

FR-604: Clicking on a region/sub-region polygon on the map shall navigate the user to the corresponding Regional Dashboard (FR-502).

FR-700: Backend API Management System

FR-701: A dedicated section in the Admin backend shall exist for managing AI service APIs.

FR-702: The Admin shall be able to enter, store, and select the active API endpoint and authentication key.

FR-703: The system's code shall be structured to call a generic "AI service" function, which then uses the currently selected API details from the database. This allows for easily "picking and choosing" or switching models (e.g., from Hugging Face to another provider) without code changes.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

5.1. Security and Data Privacy: All data, especially victim PII and assessment details, must be encrypted at rest and in transit. The system must comply with data privacy principles (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable). Access control must be strictly enforced based on user roles and regions.

5.2. Performance and Reliability: The application must be responsive, even on low-bandwidth connections typical in disaster zones. The Hugging Face API calls should be handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the user interface.

5.3. Usability and Accessibility: The UI must be simple, intuitive, and easy to use by non-technical personnel under stressful conditions.

5.4. Scalability: The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users and a large volume of victim data.

6. Data Model (Conceptual Schema)

User: id, username, password_hash, role (ForeignKey to Role), region (ForeignKey to Region).

Region: id, name, sub_region_name, geo_polygon (GeometryField).

Victim: id, victim_identifier (anonymous), demographics, registered_by (ForeignKey to User), region (ForeignKey to Region).

Assessment: id, victim (ForeignKey to Victim), assessment_data (JSONField), calculated_outcome (IntegerField), qualitative_observations (TextField), timestamp.

AIEvaluation: id, assessment (OneToOneField to Assessment), ai_summary (TextField), ai_severity (CharField), ai_suggestions (JSONField), timestamp.

FollowUp: id, victim (ForeignKey to Victim), para_counselor (ForeignKey to User), notes (TextField), timestamp.

ApiConfiguration: id, provider_name, api_endpoint, api_key, is_active (BooleanField).

7. AI Model Integration Details
7.1. Model Selection

For the free tier, a smaller, instruction-tuned model is ideal. A good starting point would be a model from the Flan-T5 family or a similar model like google/flan-t5-base available on the Hugging Face Hub. These are good at following structured instructions.

7.2. Prompt Engineering

The quality of the AI output depends heavily on the prompt. A structured prompt is essential.

Example Prompt:

You are a mental health assistant. Analyze the following data from a disaster victim and provide a preliminary assessment.

**CONTEXT:**
The victim is in a refugee camp following a recent flood.

**ASSESSMENT TOOL SCORE:**
18 out of 25 (indicates moderate distress).

**OBSERVATIONS FROM DATA COLLECTOR:**
"Victim is withdrawn and speaks in a monotone. Avoids eye contact. Mentioned not sleeping for three days and being separated from their younger brother during the evacuation. Expressed feelings of hopelessness."

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Return a JSON object with three keys: "assessment_summary", "severity", and "suggested_actions".
- "severity" must be one of: "Low", "Moderate", "High Priority".
- "suggested_actions" should be an array of 2-3 brief, actionable strings.

**JSON OUTPUT:**
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
7.3. Output Processing

The Django backend will receive the LLM's text response, parse the JSON string, validate its structure, and save the extracted fields into the AIEvaluation table in the database.

8. Development Roadmap (MVP Approach)

Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)

User login and role management (Frontliner, Para-counselor).

Victim registration and baseline assessment form.

Backend logic for calculating tool outcomes.

Integration with Hugging Face API for a single, hardcoded prompt.

A simple, non-interactive table view for Para-counselors to see victim data and the AI assessment.

Phase 2: Workflow and Dashboards

Implement follow-up functionality.

Build the individual Victim Dashboard.

Build the aggregated Regional Dashboard (without GIS).

Refine UI/UX based on initial feedback.

Phase 3: GIS and API Management

Integrate GeoDjango and Leaflet.js for the GIS map view.

Link map polygons to regional dashboards.

Build the backend Admin interface for managing API keys (FR-700).

Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Implement real-time notifications.

Develop the victim chat module.

Performance optimization and security hardening.

9. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

Risk: AI provides inaccurate or harmful suggestions.

Mitigation: The AI's role is strictly assistive. The Accuracy Disclaimer is non-negotiable and must be prominent. All AI outputs must be reviewed and validated by a human Para-counselor before any action is taken.

Risk: Data breach of sensitive victim information.

Mitigation: Implement robust security measures: end-to-end encryption, strict role-based access controls, regular security audits, and anonymization of data wherever possible (e.g., in aggregated dashboards).

Risk: Hugging Face free-tier API limitations (rate limits, downtime).

Mitigation: Implement rate-limiting and queuing on the Django side. Have a fallback mechanism (e.g., notify the para-counselor that the AI assessment is pending). The pluggable API backend (FR-700) is a key mitigation for long-term reliance.

Risk: Poor user adoption due to a complex interface.

Mitigation: Involve target users (or proxies) in the design phase. Prioritize simplicity and a mobile-first design, as field workers will likely use tablets or phones.
